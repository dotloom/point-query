    1 to include cases in which data have been subjected to a
    classification algorithm but emerged in an undefined state.
    For example, data with class 0 is sent through an algorithm
    to detect man-made structures â€“ points that emerge without
    having been assigned as belonging to structures could be
    remapped from class 0 to class 1.
